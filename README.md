Repository for Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

This repository contains the code for the projects done in the machine learning engineer nanodegree.

Project 3 is a fraud detection project that attempts to determine if a document is similar to another document. This model is then deployed on amazon sagemaker. 

The Arvato Financial services capstone is the final part of this nanodegree. I was given a proprietary dataset from Arvato Financial Services, a Bertelsmann subsidiary, and tasked with creating a customer segmentation report and an unsupervised learning model. The model was then tested on a test set on kaggle to test ROC_AUC.
